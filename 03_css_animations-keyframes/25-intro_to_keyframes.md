## Keyframe Animations

- unlike transitions, more complex, multi-component, multi-state animations
- more control over details: timing, how many times repeat, when starts

## Vs transitions

Transitions
- allow animate a **single state change**
  - start and end, one state to another

Keyframes
- allow for **multi-state animations**
  - can define unlimited "in-between" state points

Transitions
- State A -> State B

Keyframes
- State A -> State B -> C -> D -> State E, etc.
- example of animating a sun changing position and colour throughout day

Basic Exercise
- tacky/flashy animation of text

Plan
- 0%: colour: red, font-size 20px
- 25%: colour: orange
- 50%: colour: yellow
- etc
